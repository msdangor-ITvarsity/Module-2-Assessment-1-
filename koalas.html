                    <h3>KOALAS</h3>
                    <p>The koala (Phascolarctos cinereus), sometimes called the koala bear, is an arboreal herbivorous marsupial native to Australia. It is the only extant representative of the
                     family Phascolarctidae and its closest living relatives are the wombats. The koala is found in coastal areas of the mainland's eastern and southern regions, inhabiting Queensland, 
                     New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. It is easily recognisable by its stout, tailless body and large head with round, fluffy ears and large, dark nose. The koala has a body
                     length of 60–85 cm (24–33 in) and weighs 4–15 kg (9–33 lb).</p>
                     <p>The koala is classified with wombats (family Vombatidae) and several extinct families (including marsupial tapirs, marsupial lions and giant wombats) in the suborder Vombatiformes within
                     the order Diprotodontia.[10] The Vombatiformes are a sister group to a clade that includes macropods (kangaroos and wallabies) and possums.[11] The koala's lineage possibly branched off around
                     40 million years ago during the Eocene.</p>

                     <p>The koala's geographic range covers roughly 1,000,000 km2 (390,000 sq mi), and 30 ecoregions.[39] It ranges throughout mainland eastern and southeastern Australia, including the states of Queensland,
                     New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. </p>
                     <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
                     <p>You will find the koalas at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
