                    <h3>GORILLAS</h3>
                    <p>Gorillas are the largest living primates, reaching heights between 1.25 and 1.8 metres, weights between 100 and 270 kg, and arm spans up to 2.6 metres,
                     depending on species and sex. They tend to live in troops, with the leader being called a silverback. The eastern gorilla is distinguished from the western 
                     by darker fur colour and some other minor morphological differences. Gorillas tend to live 35â€“40 years in the wild.</p>
                     <p>Gorillas' natural habitats cover tropical or subtropical forest in Sub-Saharan Africa. Although their range covers a small percentage of Sub-Saharan Africa,
                     gorillas cover a wide range of elevations. The mountain gorilla inhabits the Albertine Rift montane cloud forests of the Virunga Volcanoes, ranging in altitude 
                     from 2,200 to 4,300 metres (7,200 to 14,100 ft).</p>

                     <p>There are thought to be around 316,000 western gorillas in the wild, and 5,000 eastern gorillas. Both species are classified as Critically Endangered by the
                     IUCN; all subspecies are classified as Critically Endangered with the exception of the mountain gorilla, which is classified as Endangered.</p>
                     <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
                     <p>You will find the gorillas at pen E33, right next to the monkey trail.</p>
