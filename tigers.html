                    <h3>TIGERS</h3>
                    <p>The tiger is the largest living cat species and a member of the genus Panthera. It is most recognisable for its black stripes on orange fur with 
                     a white underside. An apex predator, it primarily preys on ungulates, such as deer and wild boar. It is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator, requiring
                     large contiguous areas of habitat to support its requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring.</p>
                     <p>The tiger was first scientifically described in 1758. It once ranged widely from the Eastern Anatolia Region in the west to the Amur River basin in the east, and in the
                     south from the foothills of the Himalayas to Bali in the Sunda Islands.</p>

                     <p>The tiger is among the most recognisable and popular of the world's charismatic megafauna.</p>
                     <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
                     <p>You will find the tigers right next to the lions.</p>
