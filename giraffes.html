                    <h3>GIRAFFES</h3>
                    <p>The giraffe is a large African hoofed mammal belonging to the genus Giraffa. It is the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant on Earth. Traditionally,
                    giraffes have been thought of as one species, Giraffa camelopardalis, with nine subspecies. Most recently, researchers proposed dividing them into up to eight extant species
                    due to new research into their mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, as well as morphological measurements. Seven other extinct species of Giraffa are known from the fossil record.</p>
                    <p>The occipital condyles at the bottom of the skull allow the animal to tip its head over 90 degrees and grab food on the branches directly above them with the tongue.
                    With eyes located on the sides of the head, the giraffe has a broad visual field from its great height. Compared to other ungulates, giraffe vision is more binocular and
                    the eyes are larger with a greater retinal surface area.[58] Giraffes may see in colour and their senses of hearing and smell are sharp.</p>

                     <p>The giraffe has an extremely elongated neck, which can be up to 2.4 m (7 ft 10 in) in length. Along the neck is a mane made of short, erect hairs. The neck typically rests 
                     at an angle of 50â€“60 degrees, though juveniles are closer to 70 degrees.</p>
                     <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
                     <p>You will find the giraffes at pen E22, right next to the gemsbok.</p>
