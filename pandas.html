                    <h3>PANDAS</h3>
                    <p>The giant panda, sometimes called a panda bear or simply panda, is a bear species endemic to China.[4] It is characterised by its bold black-and-white coat and rotund body.
                     The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the red panda, a neighboring musteloid. Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda is a folivore,
                     with bamboo shoots and leaves making up more than 99% of its diet.</p>
                     <p>The giant panda has often served as China's national symbol, appeared on Chinese Gold Panda coins since 1982 and as one of the five Fuwa mascots of the 2008 Summer Olympics held
                     in Beijing.</p>

                     <p>For many decades, the precise taxonomic classification of the giant panda was under debate because it shares characteristics with both bears and raccoons.</p>
                     <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
                     <p>You will find the pandas at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
