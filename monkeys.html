                    <h3>MONKEYS</h3>
                    <p>Many monkey species are tree-dwelling (arboreal), although there are species that live primarily on the ground, such as baboons. Most species are mainly active during the day
                     (diurnal). Monkeys are generally considered to be intelligent, especially the Old World monkeys.</p>
                     <p>As apes have emerged in the monkey group as sister of the old world monkeys, characteristics that describe monkeys are generally shared by apes as well. Williams et al. outlined
                     evolutionary features, including in stem groupings, contrasted against the other primates such as the tarsiers and the lemuriformes.</p>

                     <p>Monkeys range in size from the pygmy marmoset, which can be as small as 117 mm (4+5⁄8 in) with a 172 mm (6+3⁄4 in) tail and just over 100 g (3+1⁄2 oz) in weight,[43] to the male 
                      mandrill, almost 1 m (3 ft 3 in) long and weighing up to 36 kg (79 lb).</p>
                     <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
                     <p>You will find the monkeys at pen E33, right next to the monkey trail.</p>
